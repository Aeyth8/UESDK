# Details

This is a ***(NOT)*** fork of the UESDK from Praydog, used for UEVR. [Original Link *(That you probably can't access*)](https://github.com/praydog/UESDK)

Why did I not fork it? 
Because the original repository is a fork aswell, forking the fork of forks. 

And it's originally forked from Unreal Engine's source code... 
*You can only access the source code if you are a "member" of Epic Games, because they're bastards.*

It's free to join, but it's a humongous waste of time **AND** you need a GitHub account, it's just pure **Grade A Bull**.

So I did you all the favor by not forking the forked fork, and downloaded + published it here:

So that **anyone** can access it, *with or withn't an account*.

# UEVR SDK

This is NOT the API, the API is [here](https://github.com/Aeyth8/UEFL/tree/master/include/uevr)
